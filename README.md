# Positive-Negative-Differentiator
This repository will allow you to differentiate between positive and negative reviews on amazon regarding book reviews, as well as see that data between two .csv's. ratings.csv, and books.csv.

The Ratings.CSV file is massive, even with compression I cannot get it to load within the Github's Storage, so as a temporary solution I will have the link to the rating.csv file in this README.md in order for the user to find the ratings.csv used in this project. https://github.com/zygmuntz/goodbooks-10k/blob/master/ratings.csv
The ratings.csv file is massive, I have uploaded it as a WINRar file, in hopes that the user can download it for the project, but in the off chance it doesn't work the link up above can be used as a failsafe.
