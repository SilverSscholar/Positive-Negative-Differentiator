# Positive-Negative-Differentiator
This repository will allow you to differentiate between positive and negative reviews on amazon regarding book reviews, as well as see that data between two .csv's. ratings.csv, and books.csv.

###The Ratings.CSV file is massive, even with compression I cannot get it to load within the Github's Storage, so as a temporary solution I will have the link to the rating.csv file in this README.md in order for the user to find the ratings.csv used in this project. https://github.com/zygmuntz/goodbooks-10k/blob/master/ratings.csv
The ratings.csv file is massive, and the only way it can be used within the project at the moment is downloading it from the link above. However; once both .csv files are obtained, the program should run as expected.
